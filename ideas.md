Concept
=======

It would be nice to be able to set some kind of rules. Those are language
independent and they operate on an AST that has a unified spec.

Classes needed:

- An AST class that contains nodes.
- A Bear class that allows to write some kind of rules in an easy manner that
  operate on the AST.
