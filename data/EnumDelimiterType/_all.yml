# 'block' type is the equivalent of 'indent' in coala definitions,
# without the implication that a new block must be indented, as indentation
# is typically a matter of style, and not always a property of the language.
# 'block' currently implies a new 'scope', however we may need to
# create a new delimiter type for scope, or find another way to model that.
